# PageRank-using-Hadoop-MapReduce
The  goal  of  this  project  is  to  compute  the  PageRanks  of  an  input  set  of  hyper-linked  Wikipedia  documents  using  Hadoop  MapReduce.   The  PageRank  score  of  a  web  page serves as an indicator of the importance of the page.  Many web search engines (e.g., Google) use PageRank scores in some form to rank user-submitted queries.
